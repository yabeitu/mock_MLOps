These are for the meeting 3 November

Since examination is made on 'use of git', to what extent can we use github desktop?

Can a branch be made of the given github into our setup githubs or do we have to start afresh?

Is this phrase 'dherance to standard data science MLOps project structure' in relation to repository structure? or something else?
If the above is something else, can we get an example of a 'standard data science MLOps project structure' to understand what's being asked

'Model artifact' is this different to how we've been referring to models in the past?
