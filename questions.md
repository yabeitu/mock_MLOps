These are for the meeting 3 November

Do as you want .Since examination is made on 'use of git', to what extent can we use github desktop?

Keep the fork only.  Can a branch be made of the given github into our setup githubs or do we have to start afresh?

Cookiecutter templates for repository, be able to argue for what you want. Is this phrase 'adherance to standard data science MLOps project structure' in relation to repository structure? or something else?
If the above is something else, can we get an example of a 'standard data science MLOps project structure' to understand what's being asked

We'll see more in the workflow teachings, Go output in the eg image. 'Model artifact' is this different to how we've been referring to models in the past?
