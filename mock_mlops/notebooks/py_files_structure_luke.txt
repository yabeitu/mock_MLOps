What this file is:

Having a look at the original main jupyter notebook (main.ipynb) and trying to mentally segment it into py files for the repository structure

From looking at this, i think we should try running this code as is to double check it works and how we expect before using/changing


config.py "store useful variables and configuration"

 this includes imports, variables and functions

	create artifact directory - i think all, but separate the imports from variables
	pandas dataframe print options - same as above

	helper functions - makes functions

	##check that the imports are included from:
			- read data
			- data cleaning
			- data standardization
			- data drift artifact



dataset.py "scripts to download or generate data"

	read data - getting the dates part
	
	feature selection - this edits the data
	data cleaning - all data editing
	create categorical data columns - data editing
	separate categorical and continuous columns - data editing
	
	outlier summary - outputs a csv file of said outliers might be important to be in place here

	impute data - fill in empty records (Data editing)
	data standardization - downloading and editing data
	combine data - data editing
	data drift artifact - downloading data and writing out
	binning object columns - data editing
	save gold medallion dataset - some commented out stuff might be relevant once, otherwise just a write out
